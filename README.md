# My obsession with scraping the Buff163 marketplace

Creating a scraper for the Buff163 online CS:GO marketplace was the task I had at hand at my first internship as a Software Engineer.

As I become more experienced, I find myself wanting to build pet projects, in order to master different languages, technologies, etc.

And what better project to do than a data-intensive application, that I have plenty of domain knowledge for, and that can be scaled to be a very advanced system.

### The last iteration of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/todorpopov/buff163-scraper-system)
It was build using TypeScript, Nest.js, Express.js, React, and MongoDB. It used HTTP as the underlying transport for services to communicate with one another.

Although, the frontend part got the best of me back then, I managed to learn a decent bit about all of these technologies.


# Buff163 Distributed Scraping System (BDSS)

A distributed, single-tenant, microservices application, designed to run on-premises.
Shipped as a monorepo, both for convenience, as well as to avoid cluttering my GitHub repos.

Building this suite of services is aimed at teaching me more about:
 - The Golang programming language and best practices when using it
 - Microservices, distributed systems and systems design
 - gRPC and Protocol Buffers
 - RabbitMQ and message queues
 - Angular and frontend in general
 - Orchestration using Kubernetes and Helm
