# Buff163 Distributed Scraping System (BDSS)

A distributed, single-tenant, microservices application, designed to run on-premises.
Shipped as a monorepo, both for convenience, as well as to avoid cluttering my GitHub repos.

Building this suite of services is aimed at teaching me more about:
 - The Golang programming language and best practices when using it
 - Microservices, distributed systems and systems design
 - gRPC and Protocol Buffers
 - RabbitMQ and message queues
 - Angular and frontend in general
 - Orchestration using Kubernetes and Helm

It was build using TypeScript, Nest.js, Express.js, React, and MongoDB. It used HTTP as the underlying transport for services to communicate with one another.

Although, the frontend part got the best of me back then, I managed to learn a decent bit about all of these technologies.
